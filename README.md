# FastAPI Starter Code

This starter code builds to be have lees code possible to get started with FastAPI project. while offering a robust and nice structure project âœ¨ðŸ”¥

## Feature

- âš¡ [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) A fast and asynchronous framework for building APIs.
- ðŸ§° [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com) Provides Python SQL database interactions (ORM), recommended by FastAPI.
- ðŸ’¾ [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) SQL database.
- ðŸ’¼ [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) Database management tool, offering a user-friendly web interface for interacting with your database.
- ðŸš€ **Development Environment**: Simplified development setup and process using **Docker compose**.

## Development

- Start the entire stack with Docker Compose:

  ```shell
  docker compose up -d
  ```

Now you can access these URLs:

**Server**: JSON-based web API based on OpenAPI: [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)

Automatic interactive documentation with Swagger UI (from the OpenAPI backend): [http://localhost:8888/docs](http://localhost:8888/docs)

**Adminer**: Database web administration: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Docker Compose Override

This file settings affect local development. In this file we map the **ports**, disable auto-restart, handle volumes, etc. You can add additional development configurations as needed âœ¨.

In development, when you run `docker compose up -d`, the image runs `/start-reload.sh` (in the root of the `server` services) instead of the default `/start.sh` (used in production). This script runs the app in auto-reload mode and also triggers the `/prestart.sh` script.

- **start-reload.sh & start.sh**: These scripts mainly run the `fastapi` app, but before running it, they execute `/prestart.sh`.

- **prestart.sh**: This script triggers `/app/backend_pre_start.py` and `initial_data.py` before the main app runs. They check the database health status and create the database tables for the `sqlmodel` models (if they do not exist).
  > Note: Those files copied to the root of the image in `Dockerfile`

this starter code includes an example of CRUD operations for Users, complete with modules, routes, and error handling ðŸ˜‡.
